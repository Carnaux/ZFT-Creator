# THIS IS A TESTING REPO, THE REAL SOFTWARE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN ARTOOLKIT!

## How to use with node

#### - Put the marker in the 'inputMarker' folder.

#### - Run `npm run comp` to compress. 

This will generate a file "compressedMarkers.zft" in the project folder.

#### - Run `npm run decomp` to decompress.

This will decompress the markers to the output folder.

#### - Run `npm run build` to build the index.c code.

You will need to setup the Emscripten environment first!!!

### Soon the browser version will be available
